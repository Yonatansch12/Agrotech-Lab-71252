# Agrotech Lab Final Project - Seed counter 
Made by **Gali Shaani & Yonatan Schwartz**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Motivation:
Create a cheap alternative to the [expensive machine](https://data-technologies.com/product/seed-counter-s25/) " DATA COUNT S-25 PLUS Seed Counter " which costs around 8000$.
the system we offer costs around 150$ and has a 70-95% correlation with the professional.

### System Concept
The foundation of our system relies on a fixed ultrasonic distance sensor positioned at a constant distance from the wooden stick. When a seed passes the sensor, it detects a deviation from the static reading. We have determined that a disturbance (positive or negative) of 0.4 cm will be considered a seed. We established that a disturbance within a 0.3-second interval will be counted as a single seed to prevent multiple counts of the same seed.
To regulate the seed flow rate, we integrated a vibration motor into the system, connected to a power supply, allowing us to control the flow rate effectively. We programmed the system's features using Arduino [code](https://github.com/Yonatansch12/Agrotech-Lab-71252/blob/main/Code). 
The system includes an OLED screen that displays the counting progress.

During the project, we measured the success rate of seed counting across different prototypes. The systemâ€™s success rate ranged from 70% to 92%, with the final prototype achieving the highest success rate of 92%.

### Steps for building the project:

By using the list of components above In terms of construction, we took an elevated base and attached a funnel to it, which we built at an angle so that the seeds would fall with the vibration.
Choose an elevated base and attach a funnel to it at an angle that allows the seeds to fall through vibration.
Construct additional funnels (you can improvise using test tubes, popsicle sticks, hot glue, and tape). Ensure that the final funnel directs the seeds through the HC-SR04 sensor and then into a container.
Connect the vibration motor to a power switch and a power supply. Ensure optimal operation within the range of 1.8-2.2 volts.
Connect the ESP Nano, the screen, and the HC-SR04 sensor to the breadboard, using the attached circuit diagram for reference.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Attention! Due to a shortage of the power supply component we used in the system, we utilized a power source in Fritzing to simulate it.

### improvement suggestions
To improve our system, we propose several methods that target different components of the system:
1. Higher-quality sensors: More precise laser sensors, IR sensors, or multiple sensors can ensure only one seed is counted at a time.
2. Enhancing the system's ability to control seed flow and optimize it according to the sensor's operating rate.
3. Improving the quality of materials used: lightweight metals, high-quality plastics, and a better and stronger overall framework.
4. To integrate the capability into the system to send data and counts to a web interface with easy access, which also stores the data history, you could consider using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth modules like the ESP8266 or ESP32. These modules can connect to a server or cloud service, allowing real-time data logging and easy access from any device with internet connectivity.
5. Create a stable electrical voltage for the vibration motor using a power converter that connects to the mains electricity.
6. Perform high-quality soldering for the electrical wires.
